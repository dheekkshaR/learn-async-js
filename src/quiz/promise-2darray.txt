Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

It returns a promise so we need to add the .then and .catch blocks to print the result or error.
P1 takes more time to do, P2 just rejects fast thats why the error appears befor the sum prints in the output. (computationally expensive)
